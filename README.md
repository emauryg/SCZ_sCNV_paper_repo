This github repository contains the code to generate the main figures and analyses associated with the manuscript by Maury et al. 

**Note**: Since the manuscript depends on individual level genetic data. The SNP array files and raw calls cannot be made available through a public github repository. However, individual level data can be made available by applying for access in this [link](https://www.med.unc.edu/pgc/shared-methods/how-to/). 

Filterd somatic CNV (sCNV) calls are Supplementary Table S3 of the manuscript. 

Expression analysis `analysis_abcb11.r` script was implemented by Tushar Kamath (Github: @tkamath1).
