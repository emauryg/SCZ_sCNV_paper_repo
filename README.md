## Code repository for Schizophrenia-associated somatic copy number variants from 12,834 cases reveal contribution to risk and recurrent, isoform-specific NRXN1 disruptions 

This github repository contains the code to generate the main figures and analyses associated with the manuscript by Maury et al. 

**Note**: Since the manuscript depends on individual level genetic data. The SNP array files and raw calls cannot be made available through a public github repository. However, individual level data can be made available by applying for access in this [link](https://www.med.unc.edu/pgc/shared-methods/how-to/). 

Filterd somatic CNV (sCNV) calls are Supplementary Table 1 of the manuscript.
